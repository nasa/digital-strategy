          "value": "NASA has three phases defined for Customer Engagement for Open Data. Phase One included the development of code.nasa.gov and data.nasa.gov. Code.nasa.gov and data.nasa.gov, are two major ways that NASA engages our customers. Code.nasa.gov website expands NASA’s open source activities, surfaces existing activities, provides a discussion forum, and guides internal and external groups in open development, release, and contribution. NASA hopes to lower barriers to building open technology in partnership with the public. Phase Two concentrates on open source concepts, policies, and activities at NASA, and is ongoing across the agency.  Phase Three focuses on building software tools to improve and speed open source development, including distributed version control, issue tracking, continuous integration, and documentation. Data.nasa.gov is NASA’s commitment to open data and expands the audience for the vast body of knowledge produced through NASA aeronautics and space missions. NASA actively uses GitHub as a central hub to engage developers and collaborate with the public on open source and open data efforts. Additionally, NASA requests feedback via comments on Open.NASA.gov and NASA’s Digital Strategy website for data sets or digital information the public finds most valuable. Developers, technologists, entrepreneurs, citizen scientists and many others can contribute directly to the exploration of space and Earth by helping to create new ways to leverage NASA data. As part of the Open Government Initiative and the Open Data Policy, the Agency is working to improve accessibility to this data and incentivizing the use of government data by citizens through challenge programs, such as the annual International Space Apps Challenge. NASA makes available data, software, and analytic tools through the Open.NASA.gov website that links to both the data.NASA.gov and the code.NASA.gov catalogs – which draw from NASA’s many mission-related websites. The public now has streamlined access to publicly available data and tools with information and direct links to approximately over 3000 datasets. Overall, these digital platforms and challenge programs continue to develop the community of solvers through open innovation and public engagement to the NASA Open Government Plan."

We've embarked on an ambitious citizen engagement through our crowdsourcing and challenge portfolio, where we allow our customers -- the taxpayer -- to engage with us to create innovative new solutions to problems facing humanity, both on and off the planet. NASA leads the public sector in the breadth and depth of experience and experimentation with prizes, citizen science, and challenges, much of which is based on NASA's openly available data and tools. From the International Space Apps Challenge, to Centennial Challenges, to NASA's Open Innovation Pavilion, and NASA Tournament Lab, citizens can join our journey of exploration.  Through these citizen engagement programs, NASA provides priority high value datasets -- created as an output of NASA\u2019s scientific and engineering programs \u2013 to allow the public to create innovative solutions and new products for social good, non-profit, and commercial gain. The International Space Apps Challenge, in its third year, engaged with over 8000 citizens from 95 cities and 46 countries, to create a harvest of innovation from the seeds of NASA data. We are committed to increase our customer engagement through innovative data programs to infuse innovation at the local level, as well as spurring new ways to do business in the federal government. "

In the meantime, NASA conducted a comprehensive Technical Capabilities Assessment initiative to establish a more efficient operating model that maintains critical capabilities and meets current and future mission needs. NASA has a highly complex and evolving mission dependent upon numerous technical capabilities. The intent of the agency-wide assessment has been to strategically address the technical capabilities required to support Agency goals, and to enable NASA leadership to make informed decisions about investments in infrastructure, people, and innovation needed to advance our mission. \r\n\r\nIn order to streamline processes, the OCIO assessed existing authorities for how the Agency governs digital services, and determined that OCIO processes and governing boards already have authority over digital infrastructure and capabilities. These authorities cannot be re-delegated to a newly formed Council.; therefore, the Council has been determined redundant. In order to streamline NASA capabilities, NASA management has determined that digital strategy is the responsibility of OCIO, and is embedded at all levels of  OCIO Information Technology (IT)  governance at NASA. \r\n\r\nIT governance is undertaken under the auspices of multiple standing Boards.\r\n1.\tThe IT Strategy and Investment Board has authority for decisions regarding IT strategy and resultant policies, significant IT investments (prioritization and approval), and the NASA Enterprise Architecture. \r\n2.\tThe IT Program Management Board has authority for application and infrastructure projects to ensure that investments approved by the IT Strategy and Investment Board stay on track during formulation, design, and implementation. \r\n3.\tThe IT Management Board (ITMB) has authority for decisions regarding management of the IT technical environment at NASA to implement IT strategy, policy, and investment initiatives, including configuration management, integration, and performance of IT systems.   The purpose of the ITMB is to make decisions regarding performance, integration, and other issues pertaining to operational systems. The ITMB also serves as a senior-level Configuration Control Board (CCB) for Agency infrastructure projects, reviewing and approving high-level infrastructure requirements.\r\n4.\tThe IT Systems Integration Board provides a forum for senior-level stakeholder participation in the setting of IT strategy and policy of broad impact in terms of budget or operational capacity, as well as prioritization of significant IT investments that align with the strategy and mission of the Agency. The purpose of this Board is to provide a forum for high-level Agency participation in the oversight and evaluation of Agency IT programs and projects. \r\nIn addition, OCIO is responsible for OMB E-Gov initiatives and has the authority to negotiate and commit on behalf of the Agency a set of initiatives and milestones that are in the best interest of the Agency and Federal Government.\r\n"

Solvers created innovative methods to monitor air, water, and urban pollution, track environmental mishaps, and alerts to warn citizens of weather and health-related disasters, as well as track the asteroids and celestial events. NASA is building on these efforts, and collaborating with other agencies to create solver profiles that can be used by citizens to engage with NASA and other agencies on a long-term basis.

Thus, our strategy has been to launch a series of challenges and collaboration opportunities to enable citizen developers around the world to help us in our quest to further the reach of NASA in to the mobile landscape. Events like the International Space Apps Challenge open the opportunity for thousands of citizen developers from across the planet to contribute their time to helping the agency create mobile interfaces for our programs."
